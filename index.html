              Life has such an elaborate way of presenting itself during the most unlikely times. Never would my seven year old have realized the significance of the time we are living in currently. Part of a destination is the lives lived along the way. Sure this path may not be smooth for all of us. Yet, such a wonderful journey enables us to realize the true potential of ourselves.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              I am currently in this journey of self-learning. This process seems very mediocre in a sense that there are a lot of other things that one can do. Truth is, the process is as important as anything else deemed important. On the quest to learn about oneself, I was fortunate to have met people and experienced new things that only summed up the grand calculation of learning. I continue to appreciate this journey and hope to continue doing so.
